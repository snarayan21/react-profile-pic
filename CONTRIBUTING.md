# How to contribute 

ðŸŽ‰ First of all, I'm really glad that you are reading this. Thanks for your interest in contributing with this project. I strong believe that with your help we can make it way better. I volunteer is definitely welcome. ðŸ™‚

## Testing

It currently have a small test set, wrote on Jest, for the `lib` only. This is an area that requires attention. It would be great to cover the more relevant code with tests. If you are going to touch the `lib` folder, please, make sure to update the tests and to write new ones if required.

## How to submit changes?

Please send us a GH Pull request with a clear description of what you've done. Also, I'd like to ask you to respect the coding convention and/or suggest changes if needed.
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

> $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

* I've been using 2 spaces indentation, 4 spaces for tab. (we can change that).
* Let's keep state immutable.
* We're using the current [ES2015 Class declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Class_declarations)
